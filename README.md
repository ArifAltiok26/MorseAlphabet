# What is MorseAlphabet ?

# MorseAlphabet is an approach that encodes or decodes texts using periods or dashes.

The Huffman tree is a tree data structure from which we can build on the above approach.


To get the executable of the application, clone the repo and run the build.bat file. The executable will be under Build/Release.

This application implements the huffman tree in the binary tree data structure and optionally has the ability to speak the encoded text.

This application can also be used via the command line interface if desired. You can find the capabilities and explanations of the application with the --help parameter in the cli you opened. Have fun.
